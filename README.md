# MedicalChart

### Objective
[Full Project Proposal Here](https://github.com/TLukeMcDonald/MedicalChart/blob/master/Assets/Project_Docs/Project_Proposal-Medical_Chart%20.pdf)
![Project Proposal](https://github.com/TLukeMcDonald/MedicalChart/blob/master/Assets/Project_Docs/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-18%20at%2012.32.59%20PM.png) <br>
As a military member I’ve moved frequently. As a project manager I’ve shifted under various health insurance programs and have had to routinely change doctors since they might not be covered under the new insurance.  Medical records don’t always transfer and as a patient you need to take charge of your history and be able to point out previous problems you’ve had that might be related. 

### Solution
Now you can search by body part and time series to easily see trends and patterns. Import your medical records prior to leaving doctors or when you get sick.
